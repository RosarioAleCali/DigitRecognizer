# Digit Recognizer
## Introduction
Digit Recognizer is a C++ project that uses the Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel® DAAL)<br/>
to recognize handwritten digits. This is a tipical problem in machine learning that can be solved in many different ways.<br/>
This solution to the problem uses Support Vector Machine (SVM), a supervised learning model, to demonstrate how the library can efficiently solve this problem.
## Project Description
Given a handwritten digit, the system should be able to recognize or infer what digit was written.<br/>
For the system to be able to predict the output with a given input, it needs a trained model learned from the training data set that provides the system with the capability to make an inference or prediction.
