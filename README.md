# Digit Recognizer
## Intrduction
Digit Recognizer is a C++ project that uses the Intel® Data Analytics Acceleration Library (Intel® DAAL)<br/>
to recognize handwritten digits. This is a tipical type of machine learning problem that can be solved in many different ways.<br/>
This solution to the problem uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to demonstrate how the library algorithm in Intel® DAAL can be used to solve this problem.
